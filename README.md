However, in the RosettaNet standard, a PO response is required regardless\.Note 4: Although the X12 standard has a separate response transaction for the 860, the 865, an 855 may be sent in response to an 860\.Note 5: Only one acknowledgment to the original PO may be sent using PIP3A4\. Subsequent acknowledgments must be sent using PIP3A7\.Note 6: Only one acknowledgment to the original PO may be sent using PIP3A4\. Subsequent acknowledgments must be sent using PIP3A7\.Note 7: PIP3A7 does not require the buyer to send a response to the seller's proposed change\. Trading partners need to agree on expectations and on whether a non\-response should be treated as an acceptance or a denial\. EIDX recommends that a non\-response be treated as a denial, since many buyers' applications only allow them to transmit a response if the buyer changes its own data; in a denial, the buyer is not changing its data\.Note 8: PIP 3A8 requires that PO Change Confirmation be used with PO Change\. So even when a seller\- initiated response using PIP 3A7 is responded to with a 3A8 PO Change, the PIP requires that the seller must send a 3A8 PO Confirmation, even though it is redundant\. Note 7: Only one acknowledgment to the original PO may be sent using PIP3A4\. Subsequent acknowledgments must be sent using PIP3A7\. |                       |                            |                  |                                                           |

Some buyers' systems do not need a "reverse release" sent for SMI shipments\. Some buyers' systems only create open receivables when the buyer issues the release in their system\. In the Supplier\-Managed Inventory environment, the Ship Notice can be used by the buyer as a "reverse release", in order to create an open receivable in the system for the goods the supplier has shipped\.Note 14:  To be confirmed\.
